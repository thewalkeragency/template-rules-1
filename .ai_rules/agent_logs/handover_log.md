# Agent Handover Log

This log serves as a communication channel between AI agents working on the `memex.tech` project. It is used to record significant progress, decisions, open questions, and any information necessary for a smooth handover of responsibilities.

## How to Use This Log

*   **New Entry:** Add new entries at the top of the log (most recent first).
*   **Format:** Use the provided template for each entry.
*   **Clarity:** Be concise but clear. Assume the reading agent has context of the project but needs specific updates.
*   **Sign-off:** Always include the `Agent:` and `Timestamp:` for accountability.

## Log Entries

### 2025-06-30 - Handover: KnowledgeReinforcer Web App Fixes & NLTK Setup

**Agent:** Gemini CLI
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-30 20:00:00 UTC

**Status Update:**
*   Resolved `LookupError` for NLTK resources by implementing a robust, self-contained NLTK data management system in `knowledge_reinforcer/nltk_setup.py`. This ensures `punkt_tab` and `stopwords` are downloaded to a project-local directory and correctly located.
*   Fixed `NameError: name 'datetime' is not defined` in `knowledge_reinforcer/web_app.py` by adding the missing `from datetime import datetime` import.
*   Addressed "Address already in use" errors by iteratively adjusting the web application's port in `knowledge_reinforcer/main.py` and confirming functionality on `http://localhost:3001`.

**Decisions Made:**
*   Prioritized fixing critical errors to ensure the `KnowledgeReinforcer` web application is fully functional.
*   Implemented automated NLTK resource management for improved portability and reduced manual setup.
*   Re-enabled debug mode temporarily to capture detailed error tracebacks, then disabled it once the issue was identified and resolved.

**Open Questions/Pending Tasks:**
*   Further testing of the `KnowledgeReinforcer` web interface with various inputs (URLs, direct text) is recommended.

**Context/Notes for Next Agent:**
*   The `KnowledgeReinforcer` web application is now stable and accessible at `http://localhost:3001`.
*   The NLTK data is managed automatically within the `knowledge_reinforcer/nltk_data/` directory.
*   The `web_app.py` now correctly handles `datetime` operations.

### 2025-06-30 - Handover: KnowledgeReinforcer Feature Implementation Complete

**Agent:** Gemini CLI
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-30 19:30:00 UTC

**Status Update:**
*   Completed implementation of all three proposed features for the `KnowledgeReinforcer` application:
    1.  **Automated Extractive Summarization:** Implemented in `knowledge_reinforcer/processor.py`.
    2.  **Enhanced Keyword/Concept Extraction:** Implemented in `knowledge_reinforcer/processor.py`.
    3.  **Simple Web Interface for Input & Browsing:** Implemented with `knowledge_reinforcer/web_app.py` and associated HTML templates.
*   Updated `knowledge_reinforcer/requirements.txt` with new dependencies (`Flask`, `markdown`).
*   Updated `knowledge_reinforcer/main.py` to include the `--web` argument for running the web interface.

**Decisions Made:**
*   Proceeded with full implementation of the features as outlined in the previous handover log entry.

**Open Questions/Pending Tasks:**
*   Verification of the implemented features by Jules AI.

**Context/Notes for Next Agent (Jules AI):**

Jules, the `KnowledgeReinforcer` application has been fully implemented as per the build plans detailed in the previous log entry. Your task is to now **verify my work against those build plans**. Please:

1.  **Review the code changes** for each feature (Summarization, Keyword Extraction, Web UI).
2.  **Test the functionality** of each feature.
3.  **Report your findings directly to the human user.** Do not report back to me. Your report should confirm whether the features were implemented as planned and if they are working correctly. If there are any discrepancies or issues, please detail them.

To run the web app for testing:
```bash
cd /Volumes/X SSD 2025/Users/narrowchannel/template-rules-1
source knowledge_reinforcer/.venv/bin/activate
python3 -m knowledge_reinforcer.main --web
```
Access the web UI at `http://localhost:3000`.

To test CLI functionality (e.g., summarization/keywords):
```bash
cd /Volumes/X SSD 2025/Users/narrowchannel/template-rules-1
source knowledge_reinforcer/.venv/bin/activate
python3 -m knowledge_reinforcer.main --url "https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/28/24188000/ai-agents-future-of-work-automation-microsoft-google" --tags "AI,Agents" --purpose "Test summarization and keywords"
```

### 2025-06-30 - Updated Global Rules with Handover Protocol

**Agent:** Gemini CLI
**Timestamp:** 2025-06-30 18:00:00 UTC

**Status Update:**
*   Added new global rule `1.7. Agent Handover Protocol: Code Review & Human Clarification` to `00_GLOBAL.md`.
*   This rule mandates code review and human clarification during agent handovers.
*   Successfully demonstrated `KnowledgeReinforcer` with direct text input.

**Decisions Made:**
*   The new handover protocol is now formally documented in the global rules.

**Open Questions/Pending Tasks:**
*   The `KnowledgeReinforcer` needs further testing with various URL types (web articles, YouTube videos).
*   Consider implementing the web UI for `KnowledgeReinforcer` as a future task.

**Context/Notes for Next Agent:**
*   The project now has a formal handover protocol. Any agent taking over should review `00_GLOBAL.md` and this log.
*   The `KnowledgeReinforcer` is functional for direct text input. Its code is located in `knowledge_reinforcer/`.
