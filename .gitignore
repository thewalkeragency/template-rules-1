# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending
#   on the platform. To avoid unpredictable behaviors, data loss or other unexpected issues, you
#   may want to add Pipfile.lock to your .gitignore file.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially true if you want to ensure reproducible builds across different environments.
#   However, if you prefer to keep it out of version control, uncomment the following line.
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
# pdm.lock
# .pdm.toml
